## Core Features
* **Incremental "Upsert" Data Loading:** Never downloads the same day twice. The engine reads the latest local Parquet file and fetches only the missing trading days from Yahoo Finance.

* **Asset-Class Aware Calendar Logic:** Automatically routes lookback periods based on the asset class. Skips weekends and US Federal holidays for equities (e.g., NVDA), but calculates true 24/7 lookbacks for crypto (e.g., BTC).

* **Resilient Parquet Schema:** Avoids MultiIndex corruption by flattening Yahoo Finance outputs, enforcing a strict column-based Date and Ticker schema on disk, and promoting the Date to a DatetimeIndex in RAM for time-series analysis.

* **Vectorized Backtesting:** Eliminates slow for loops. Uses pandas matrix math (shift, diff, cumprod) to execute simulated trades over decades of data in milliseconds.

* **Interactive CLI Dashboard:** Includes a live terminal menu to run backtests, view metrics, or wipe the data cache on the fly.

* **Visual Montages:** Automatically generates a side-by-side Matplotlib dashboard showing exact Buy/Sell execution arrows alongside the cumulative equity curve.
